# Zero_Hunger
This app is a solution for the united nations sustainable development goal 02 - To reduce food waste and hunger

This application has 4 types of users.
1. Restaurant/Hotel owners are allowed to enter the surplus food of the day to the system mentioning the type of the food , amount of the food.
2. Orphanages/People in need see the available food for the day and they request the food through the app.
3. Volunteers act as the bridge between them to deliver the food from the restaurants/hotels to the people in need.They are notified through the app to distribute the food near them.
4. Admins manage users and analyze the status of the system.

This is the project we did for our 3rd year 1st semester for the module UEE(User Experience Engineering).
